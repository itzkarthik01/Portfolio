        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Traffic congestion significantly delays emergency response times. This IoT-based system detects approaching ambulances and dynamically adjusts traffic signals to prioritize emergency vehicles. Using an ESP8266 microcontroller, the system integrates a sound detection module to recognize ambulance sirens, activating a priority-based traffic light system.</p>
        
        <p>The three-way junction system uses potentiometers to simulate multiple roads:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Junction road (highest priority)</strong> - Blocks all other roads if an ambulance is detected.</li>
            <li><strong>Parallel roads (lower priority)</strong> - Allowed simultaneous green signals if no emergency is detected.</li>
            <li><strong>FIFO-based queueing</strong> - If multiple ambulances arrive, they are managed based on a first-in, first-out algorithm.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The project runs on Wokwi for simulation and later integrates a real-time Python module to enhance detection accuracy. This system can be extended to real-world smart city implementations.</p>
