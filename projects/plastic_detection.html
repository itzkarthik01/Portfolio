        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Plastic pollution is a growing environmental issue, and detecting plastic waste in water bodies is crucial for ecological conservation. This project leverages deep learning and computer vision to identify plastic objects floating on water surfaces. Using a high-resolution camera and depth sensors, the system captures real-time images, which are processed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify detected objects as plastic or non-plastic.</p>
        
        <p>The project integrates reinforcement learning to guide an autonomous boat to navigate toward detected plastics for collection. The model is trained using datasets containing images of water bodies with and without plastic debris, improving its accuracy in differentiating between natural elements (like leaves) and synthetic waste. This system aims to assist in automated waste collection efforts and environmental monitoring, potentially integrating with IoT-based solutions for large-scale deployments.</p>
