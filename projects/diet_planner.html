        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Nutrition plays a crucial role in overall well-being, and dietary choices should be tailored based on weather conditions and health requirements. This project is a smart meal recommendation system that considers temperature, humidity, and user health conditions (diabetes, blood pressure, etc.) to suggest optimal meal plans.</p>
        
        <p>The system fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API and cross-references it with a userâ€™s dietary needs and preferences. For example, during hot weather, it recommends hydrating foods, while cold weather calls for high-energy meals. A machine learning model personalizes recommendations based on historical food choices and health indicators. The project is implemented with FastAPI for backend processing and a React-based frontend, offering users an intuitive interface to generate and track meal plans.</p>
